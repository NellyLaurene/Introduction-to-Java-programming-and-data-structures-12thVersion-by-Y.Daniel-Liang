//     (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
//    to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
//    should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
//    and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
//            Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
//    where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in
//    degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
